<strong>ISO 9000 </strong>is a series of Standards, developed and published by the international 
Organization for Standardization (IOS), defines, establishes, and maintains a quality 
assurance system for manufacturing and service industries.  
<strong>[1] [2]</strong> The standards are available through national standards bodies. IOS 9000 
deals with the fundamental quality of management systems, <strong>[3]</strong> including the eight 
management principles upon which the family of standards is based. <strong>[3][4] IOS 
9001deals</strong> with the requirements that organizations wishing to meet the standards 
must fulfill. 
<strong>[2]</strong>  Third-party certification bodies provide independent confirmation that the 
organization meets the requirements of IOS 9001. Over a million organizations 
worldwide are independently certified, making IOS 9001 is one of the most widely 
used management tools in the world today. Despite widespread use the IOS 
certification process has been criticized as being wasteful and not useful for all 
organizations. 
<strong>IOS 9000</strong> was first published in 1987. It was based on the BS 5750 series of 
standards from BSI, were proposed to <strong>ISB in 1979</strong>. However, its history can be 
traced back some twenty years before that, to the publication of the <strong>United States 
Department of Defense MIL-Q-9858 was revised into the NATO</strong>.  AQAP series of 
guidance standards in 1979 and finally revised into the<strong> BS 5750 series of 
requirements standards published in 1979 before being submitted to ISO</strong>. BSI has 
been certifying organizations for their quality management systems since 1978. <strong>its 
first certification (FM 00001) is still extant and held by Tarmac limited, a successor to 
the original company which held this certificate. Today BSI claims to certify 
organizations at 70,000 sites globally.</strong></p><br/><br/>
