hire and Security employ: 
<strong>Our Labour Hire and Security is always on the lookout for any signs that may 
indicate a possible strike situation and report it immediately to management</strong>. 
In case of <strong>peaceful strike, non-striking</strong> security officers must maintain a low profile 
but with alertness. 
<strong>Officers must be careful and not appear heavily armed as this may cause a violent 
reaction</strong>. 
Where possible, avoid<strong> SAPS involvement</strong> unless violence occurs and if authorization 
was obtained beforehand from management. 
Maintain a chronological diary of events. 
Management must be informed daily on strikes situations and negotiation results in 
the union/workforce. 
Detail planning of guarding system and alternative manpower resources must be in 
place within <strong>24 hours </strong>after confirmation of strike. Including an induction-training plan 
for alternative manpower. 
<strong>The securing of all security equipment [weapons,radios, etc.]</strong>. 
Report to management immediately when an unrest situation/strike situation starts. 
Obtain and provide management with full details, who, what, when, where, why, 
how. 
<strong>Officers must not meddle with negotiations between management and fellow strikers</strong>. 
If strike develops into <strong>riot action and SAPS </strong>are called in, security officials must follow 
orders of the members in charge of SAPS. 
Keep a written record of all events, documents, and acts.
